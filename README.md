# JSF CA Ecom Store

This is a simple eCommerce demo built with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite**. It fetches product data from the [Noroff online shop API](https://v2.api.noroff.dev/online-shop) and demonstrates routing, state management and form handling.

## Features

- Product listing with search
- Detailed product pages including rating and reviews
- Shopping cart stored in `localStorage`
- Checkout confirmation page
- Contact form with client side validation
- Light/dark theme toggle

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Linting

Run ESLint to check the code style:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Testing

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Project structure

- `src/api` – API helpers
- `src/components` – reusable UI components
- `src/layout` – page layout with header, footer and breadcrumbs
- `src/pages` – React Router pages
- `src/providers` – context providers (theme and cart)

## Component Library

The UI layer is built with **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** – a collection of unstyled, accessible React components designed to be styled with **Tailwind CSS**.  
Instead of shipping a monolithic package, `shadcn/ui` provides a small CLI that _copies_ component source files directly into the codebase.
With this approach, each component resides within the repository, allowing full inspection, customisation, and extension of the markup or styles at any time.

**Why shadcn/ui?**

- **Accessibility first** – built on fully accessible Radix primitives.
- **No vendor lock‑in** – components are local files, not opaque npm packages.
- **Tailwind‑ready** – each component comes with sensible Tailwind classes you can tweak in seconds.
- **Typesafe** – written in TypeScript with excellent IntelliSense support.

### Tailwind CSS setup

Tailwind serves as the utility‑first styling engine and pairs seamlessly with shadcn/ui:

1. **Class merging** – the project uses the `cn()` helper (a thin wrapper around `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`) to avoid duplicate classes when composing styles.
2. **Animations & dark mode** – shadcn/ui components include optional animation classes and respect the app’s dark/light theme via the `data-theme` attribute set by `ThemeProvider`.

To scaffold a new component from the library, run:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>
```

The CLI copies the source into `src/components/ui/` and automatically wires it up to the existing Tailwind setup.
